**Firefly SrTools** is a modern, high-performance web toolkit designed to streamline workflows and provide essential services. This project is built upon the powerful synergy of the **Next.js** framework and the ultra-fast **Bun.js** runtime, ensuring lightning-fast development and deployment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Bun** installed on your system.

Install Bun (macOS, WSL, Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL [https://bun.sh/install](https://bun.sh/install) | bash
```

## Development

```bash
bun install
```

```bash
bun run dev
```

```bash
bun run build
bun run start
```

## Data transport

`/api/data/:name` serves the brotli files in `data/` as they are; nothing is split or
packed here. `data/` is a copy of `full/brotli/` from srtools-converter (see its README), which
already writes the views the first screen needs: `metadata_core` and `metadata_stage` (the
battle-only `Stage` records), `avatar_index` (the avatar list without skills, eidolons or full
skill trees) and one `avatar_detail/<id>` per avatar. A file in a subfolder is served as
`<folder>_<file>`, so `avatar_detail/1001.json.br` is `/api/data/avatar_detail_1001`.

To update the data: run the converter, then copy `convert/full/brotli/` over `data/`
(keep `changelog.json`) and delete `avatar.json.br` and `metadata.json.br`: the whole documents
are only the source of the views, and the client never requests them.

Data responses revalidate using content ETags instead of timestamp cache-busting.
In development the original files are served and changes are checked per dataset.

Run `bun run test` for lightweight data/battle/persistence regression tests.

## Maintaining battle rules

* `src/helper/battleConfig.ts`: pure, typed rules, with one entry point per mode:
  `deriveMocConfig`, `derivePfConfig`, `deriveAsConfig`, `derivePeakConfig`, and
  `fillTheoryCraftHP`. Change a mode's rules in its function; shared helpers only
  handle side selection, stage-to-monster mapping, and unchanged-result checks.
* `src/lib/battleConfigSync.ts`: store subscriptions and one explicit case per
  mode. Add a new mode's config/data dependency, calculator, and setter here.
  Do not put buffs, cycle limits, or enemy calculation in this file or the modal.
* `bun test tests/battleConfig.test.mjs`: focused regressions, no browser needed.
